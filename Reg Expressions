/*
Write a JavaScript function to test if the words: dog, cat, or chicken is in a string.

(Hint: you will need to use \b for a word boundary)

Simply put: \b allows you to perform a "whole words only" search using a regular expression in the form of \bword\b.  A "word character" is a character that can be used to form words. All  characters that are not "word characters" are "non-word characters"
